# How I Deciphered the Supposed Code of the Somerton Man

## 🧾 The Original Message (Found in the Book):

```
WRGOABABD  
WTBIMPANETP  
MLIABOAIAQC  
ITTMTSAMSTGAB
```

This mysterious code was written in capital letters on the back of a copy of The Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam, found in a car linked to the unknown “Somerton Man.” For decades, the letters were believed to represent an unbreakable cipher — potentially even a Cold War-era code.

## 🧠 My Breakthrough: It’s an Acrostic, Not a Cipher

Instead of interpreting the message as an encrypted text (e.g. Vigenère, substitution, etc.), I treated it as an acrostic: where each letter is the first letter of a word, forming a meaningful message when reconstructed properly.

This poetic technique is used in notes, music, mnemonics — and plausibly, in a farewell message.

## 📜 My Deciphered Message

> “We remember grieving over a broken and beautiful day.  
Wrote this because I'm missing peace and nothing else to protect.  
My love is a beautiful one and I am always quietly crying.  
If this truly means the sadness and memory shall truly go away, beloved.”

## 🔍 Step-by-Step Logic

### 1. Context Matters

The body was found in 1948 on an Australian beach, well-dressed, anonymous, and carrying a small scrap of paper reading "Tamám Shud" — meaning “It is ended.” All signs pointed to a voluntary act, likely a suicide, and the tone surrounding the code seemed deeply personal.

### 2. Thematic Word Selection

Based on the emotional context (loss, love, finality), I created a list of likely English words that begin with each letter from the code — especially focusing on:

- Love and memory (e.g., Remember, Love, Beloved)
- Sadness and inner turmoil (e.g., Broken, Crying, Grieving)
- Peaceful resolution (e.g., Peace, Away, Quietly)

### 3. Line-by-Line Decryption

**Line 1: WRGOABABD**  
> We Remember Grieving Over A Broken And Beautiful Day

- All words fit naturally and emotionally.
- No forced syntax or obscure vocabulary.
- Consistent with a grieving, poetic tone.

**Line 2: WTBIMPANETP**  
> Wrote This Because I'm Missing Peace And Nothing Else To Protect

- "Nothing else to protect" implies resignation or loss of purpose.
- Suggests emotional pain and a goodbye.

**Line 3: MLIABOAIAQC**  
> My Love Is A Beautiful One And I Am Always Quietly Crying

- Deeply personal.
- "Quietly crying" gives emotional resonance, matching themes of grief.

**Line 4: ITTMTSAMSTGAB**  
> If This Truly Means The Sadness And Memory Shall Truly Go Away, Beloved

- Feels like a final line in a poem or suicide note.
- Addresses a “beloved,” possibly a lost partner.

## ✅ Why This Interpretation Makes Sense

- Emotionally consistent: It reads like an authentic expression of personal pain.
- Poetically structured: The rhythm and tone feel deliberate, not random.
- Fits the physical evidence: The Tamám Shud note, the lack of ID, and the method of death all align with an intentional, symbolic farewell.
- Alternative theories are weaker: No cipher has matched this text in 75+ years using traditional cryptography.

## 🏁 Conclusion

I believe this interpretation of the Tamám Shud code provides the most plausible reading to date. It’s a poetic, emotionally charged farewell from a man who may have lost his love and saw no reason to continue. Whether a personal tragedy or something darker occurred, this message seems to be his final attempt to say goodbye — hidden in plain sight.
